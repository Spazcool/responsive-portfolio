# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. The following is my work toward that goal.

<div>
   <img width="70%" height="80vh" src="/Assets/Images/desktop.gif">
   <img width="20%" height="80vh" src="/Assets/Images/mobile.gif">
</div>

## What I've done:
* navbar
* dropdown with links to other pages
* footer
* email submission form
* responsive breakpoints around mobile, tablets & desktops
* calls to NASA API random images
