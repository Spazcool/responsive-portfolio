# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. The following is my work toward that goal.

<p align="center">
   <img width="70%" height="300vh" src="/Assets/Images/desktop.gif">
   <img width="20%" height="300vh" src="/Assets/Images/mobile.gif">
</p>

## What you'll notice:
* responsive breakpoints around mobile, tablets & desktops
* navbar
* dropdown with links to other pages
* footer
* email submission form
* calls to NASA API for random images
* favicon
* links
